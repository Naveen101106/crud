This Flask application provides a user management system with JWT authentication using a PostgreSQL database. Users can register (/register), log in (/login), and receive a JWT token for authentication. The /protected route is secured and requires a valid token to access. It also allows retrieving all users (/users), fetching a specific user by ID (/users/<user_id>), and deleting users (/users/<user_id>).
